**6th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by *[Wall of Force](wall-of-force)*.

A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a *[True Resurrection](true-resurrection)* or a *[Wish](wish)* spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.
