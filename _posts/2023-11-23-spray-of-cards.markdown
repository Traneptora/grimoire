**2nd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (15-foot cone)

**Components**: V, S, M (a deck of cards)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You spray a 15-foot cone of spectral cards. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 force damage and has the blinded condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
