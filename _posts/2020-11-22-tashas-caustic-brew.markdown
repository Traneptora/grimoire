**1st-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (30-foot line)

**Components**: V, S, M (a bit of rotten food)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A stream of acid emanates from you in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for the spell’s duration or until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off itself or another creature. A creature covered in acid takes 2d4 acid damage at the start of each of its turns.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.
