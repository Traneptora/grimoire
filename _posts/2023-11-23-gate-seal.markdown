**4th-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a broken portal key, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: 24 hours

You fortify the fabric of the planes in a 30-foot cube you can see within range. Within that area, portals close and canâ€™t be opened for the duration. Spells and other effects that allow planar travel or open portals, such as *[Gate](gate)* or *[Plane Shift](plane-shift)*, fail if used to enter or leave the area. The cube is stationary.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled.
