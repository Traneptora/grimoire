**7th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 150 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot-cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that arenâ€™t being worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the area is unaffected by this spell.
