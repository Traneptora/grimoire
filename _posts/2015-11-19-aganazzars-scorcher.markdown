**2nd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a red dragon’s scale)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A line of roaring flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
