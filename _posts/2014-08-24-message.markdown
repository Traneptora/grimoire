**Transmutation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)

**Duration**: 1 round

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesnâ€™t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.
