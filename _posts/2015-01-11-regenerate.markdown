**7th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water)

**Duration**: 1 hour

You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).

The targetâ€™s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.
