**1st-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 damage + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attackâ€™s damage type, as shown below.

|d8 |Damage Type|
|---|:---------:|
|1  |Acid       |
|2  |Cold       |
|3  |Fire       |
|4  |Force      |
|5  |Lightning  |
|6  |Poison     |
|7  |Psychic    |
|8  |Thunder    |

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.
