**1st-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)

**Duration**: 8 hours

You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target’s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.
