**3rd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (60-foot cone)

**Components**: V, S, M (one piece of ammunition or a thrown weapon)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition into the air to create a cone of identical weapons that shoot forward and then disappear. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.
