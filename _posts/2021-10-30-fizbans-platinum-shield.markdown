**6th-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a platinum-plated dragon scale, worth at least 500 gp)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a field of silvery light that surrounds a creature of your choice within range (you can choose yourself). The field sheds dim light out to 5 feet. While surrounded by the field, a creature gains the following benefits:

**Cover.** The creature has half cover.

**Damage Resistance.** The creature has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison damage.

**Evasion.** If the creature is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the creature instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

As a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the field to another creature within 60 feet of the field.
