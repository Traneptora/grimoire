**4th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a black marble)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A 20-foot-radius sphere of crushing force forms at a point you can see within range and tugs at the creatures there. Each creature in the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d10 force damage and is pulled in a straight line toward the center of the sphere, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible (even if that space is in the air). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t pulled.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.
