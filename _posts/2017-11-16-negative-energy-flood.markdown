**5th-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, M (a broken bone and a square of black silk)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a zombie at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. Statistics for the zombie are in the *Monster Manual*.

If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesnâ€™t make a saving throw. Instead, roll 5d12. The target gains half the total as temporary hit points.
