**5th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You flourish the weapon used in the casting and then vanish to strike like the wind. Choose up to five creatures you can see within range. Make a melee spell attack against each target. On a hit, a target takes 6d10 force damage.

You can then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of one of the targets you hit or missed.
