**8th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 150 feet

**Components**: V, M (a drop of pitch mixed with a drop of mercury)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to ﬁll a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area. 

Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 8d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
