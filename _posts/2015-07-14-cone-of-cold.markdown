**5th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (60-foot cone)

**Components**: V, S, M (a small crystal or a glass cone)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
