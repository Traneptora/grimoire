**5th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (pinch of sulfur)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
