**5th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a crystal rod worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

Holding the rod used in the casting of the spell, you touch a Large or smaller chair that is unoccupied. The rod disappears, and the chair is transformed into a spelljamming helm.
