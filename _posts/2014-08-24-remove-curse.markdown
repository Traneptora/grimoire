**3rd-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magical item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
