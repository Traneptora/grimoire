**1st-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (15-foot cone)

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Freezing cold blasts from your fingertips in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The cold freezes nonmagical liquids in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.

**At higher levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
