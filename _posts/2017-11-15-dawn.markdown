**5th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a sunburst pendant worth at least 100 gp)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

The light of dawn shines down on a location you specify within range. Until the spell ends, a 30-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder of bright light glimmers there. This light is sunlight.

When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the cylinder.

If youâ€™re within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet as a bonus action on your turn.
