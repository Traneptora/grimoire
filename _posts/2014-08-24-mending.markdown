**Transmutation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (two lodestones)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no longer than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell canâ€™t restore magic to such an object.
