**Transmutation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: S

**Duration**: Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)

You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:

 * You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.

 * You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.

 * You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.

 * You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
