**Abjuration cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a miniature cloak)

You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.
