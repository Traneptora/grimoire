**2nd level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V

A strong wind (20 miles per hour) blows around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for the spell’s duration.

The wind has the following effects:

* It deafens you and other creatures in its area.
* It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.
* The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.
* The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if they pass in or out of the wind.
* It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.
