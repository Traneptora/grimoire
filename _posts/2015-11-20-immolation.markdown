**5th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the spell's duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one. These magical flames can't be extinguished through non-magical means.

If damage from this spell reduces a target to 0 hit points, the target is turned to ash.
