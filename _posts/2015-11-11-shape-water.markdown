**Transmutation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: S

**Duration**: Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)

You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways.

 * You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.

 * You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.

 * You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.

 * You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
