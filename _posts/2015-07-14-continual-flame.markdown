**2nd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: Until dispelled

A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A *continual flame* can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.
