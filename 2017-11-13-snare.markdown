**1st-level Abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: S, M (25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: 8 hours

  As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.
	  This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation), check against your spell save DC to be discerned.
	  The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell’s radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends. 
	  A restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends.
	  After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is restrained by it.
